# üìù What is this?
This repository houses the code for `Fiveable Cram Support Bot` used in the [Fiveable Discord server](discord.gg/thinkfiveable). Used whenever a customer has an issue with a purchase, and needs to contact a member of the Student Success team.

# ü§î How do I open a ticket?

You dm the bot a message, which will start the question process. If a user does not respond quick enough or provides invalid data, the ticket creation is cancelled.
